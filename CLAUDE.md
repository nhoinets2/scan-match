<stack>
  Expo SDK 53, React Native 0.76.7, npm (not bun).
  React Query for server/async state.
  NativeWind + Tailwind v3 for styling.
  react-native-reanimated v3 for animations (preferred over Animated from react-native).
  react-native-gesture-handler for gestures.
  lucide-react-native for icons.
  
  Dependencies are managed via npm + package-lock.json.
  DO NOT add new packages unless necessary.
  Allowed: @expo-google-fonts/* or small pure-JS helpers (lodash, dayjs, etc.) IF needed.
  If you propose adding a package, explain why and list alternatives.
</stack>

<structure>
  src/app/            — Expo Router file-based routes (src/app/_layout.tsx is root). Add new screens here.
  src/components/     — Reusable UI components.
  src/lib/            — Utilities, services, and clients (e.g., cn.ts, supabase.ts, trust-filter/).
  supabase/functions/ — Edge Functions (Deno runtime, server-side AI calls).
  maestro-tests/      — E2E tests (Maestro).
</structure>

<typescript>
  Explicit type annotations for useState: `useState<Type[]>([])` not `useState([])`
  Null/undefined handling: use optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`
  Include ALL required properties when creating objects — TypeScript strict mode is enabled.
</typescript>

<environment>
  You are working in a LOCAL development environment on the user's Mac, inside the repository folder.
  The user edits code in Cursor and can run commands in an integrated terminal.
  The user runs Expo Metro locally (typically on port 8081) and uses an iOS Development Build on their phone.
  Hot reload / Fast Refresh should work when Metro is running.

  ✅ YOU MAY:
  - Use git locally (status/add/commit/push) BUT always ask before pushing, and never commit secrets.
  - Suggest terminal commands for the user to run (npm, expo, eas, git).
  - Edit project files directly and explain what changed.
  - Use EAS Build/Submit for dev builds, preview builds, and TestFlight.

  ❌ DO NOT:
  - Assume Vibecode exists (no ENV/API/LOGS tabs).
  - Tell the user to use Vibecode App or any Vibecode UI.
  - Add or request EXPO_PUBLIC_* secrets for OpenAI (OpenAI keys must remain server-side, e.g., Supabase Edge Functions).
  - Commit .env or any credentials. Never print keys. Never paste secrets into logs or code.

  Logging:
  - Logs are visible in the local terminal running `npx expo start` and in the device/dev build.
  - If you need additional diagnostics, ask the user to paste terminal output or screenshots.

  Environment variables:
  - Local dev uses a `.env` file (not committed) + `.env.example` for placeholders.
  - Cloud builds (EAS/TestFlight) must use EAS Secrets, not local `.env`.

  Package management:
  - Use npm + package-lock.json only. Do not introduce bun.lockb/yarn.lock/pnpm-lock.yaml unless explicitly requested.
  - If dependencies change, update package-lock.json and explain why.

  Workflow defaults:
  - Start dev: `npx expo start --dev-client`
  - If issues: `npx expo start --dev-client -c`
  - Install deps: `npm install`
</environment>

<docs_and_versioning>
  This repo has living documentation. When code changes affect behavior, update docs in the same PR/commit.

  Files:
  - COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md = system behavior, UI states, decision tables.
  - CHANGELOG.md = what changed + why (user-visible changes).
  - VERSIONS.md = 3 version types (app, build, schema/behavior) + version constant reference.
  - docs/handoff = agent handoffs and implementation notes.

  When to update what:
  - Code fix / small change → add CHANGELOG.md entry
  - Behavior change affecting caches/outputs → bump version constant in code + update VERSIONS.md table
  - Architecture/UI state/decision logic change → update COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md

  Never put secrets in docs.
</docs_and_versioning>

<secrets>
  Never commit secrets (API keys, service keys, .p8 files, certificates).
  Never add real values to `.env.example`.
  If a secret was committed in history, remove it properly (rewrite history) or rotate it.
  Assume GitHub push-protection may block pushes if secrets appear in commits.
</secrets>

<agent_rules>
  - Make changes in small batches (1–3 files), then summarize.
  - After each batch, provide exact commands to run to verify.
  - Never change dependency versions unless required; if required, propose first.
  - Always keep the app running (avoid breaking the build).
  - Never modify `.env` values or request secrets; only update `.env.example`.
</agent_rules>

<testing>
  Jest for unit tests: src/lib/__tests__/
  Maestro for E2E tests: maestro-tests/
  Run: `npm test` (Jest)
  Before modifying core logic (Confidence Engine, Trust Filter, etc.), check for existing tests.
</testing>

<release_pipeline>
  Local dev uses `.env` (not committed).
  EAS cloud builds do NOT read local `.env`.
  For TestFlight/production builds, required EXPO_PUBLIC_* vars must be set via EAS Secrets or EAS Environment Variables.
  Bundle identifier must remain stable to keep the same App Store Connect app.
</release_pipeline>

<forbidden_files>
  Do not edit unless explicitly asked: patches/, babel.config.js, metro.config.js, app.json, tsconfig.json, nativewind-env.d.ts
</forbidden_files>

<routing>
  Expo Router for file-based routing. Every file in src/app/ becomes a route.
  Never delete or refactor RootLayoutNav from src/app/_layout.tsx.
  
  <stack_router>
    src/app/_layout.tsx (root layout), src/app/index.tsx (matches '/'), src/app/settings.tsx (matches '/settings')
    Use <Stack.Screen options={{ title, headerStyle, ... }} /> inside pages to customize headers.
  </stack_router>
  
  <tabs_router>
    Only files registered in src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx become actual tabs.
    Unregistered files in (tabs)/ are routes within tabs, not separate tabs.
    Nested stacks create double headers — remove header from tabs, add stack inside each tab.
    At least 2 tabs or don't use tabs at all — single tab looks bad.
  </tabs_router>
  
  <router_selection>
    Games should avoid tabs — use full-screen stacks instead.
    For full-screen overlays/modals outside tabs: create route in src/app/ (not src/app/(tabs)/), 
    then add `<Stack.Screen name="page" options={{ presentation: "modal" }} />` in src/app/_layout.tsx.
  </router_selection>
  
  <rules>
    Only ONE route can map to "/" — can't have both src/app/index.tsx and src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx.
    Dynamic params: use `const { id } = useLocalSearchParams()` from expo-router.
  </rules>
</routing>

<state>
  React Query for server/async state. Always use object API: `useQuery({ queryKey, queryFn })`.
  Never wrap RootLayoutNav directly.
  React Query provider must be outermost; nest other providers inside it.
  
  Use `useMutation` for async operations — no manual `setIsLoading` patterns.
  Wrap third-party lib calls (RevenueCat, etc.) in useQuery/useMutation for consistent loading states.
  Reuse query keys across components to share cached data — don't create duplicate providers.
  
  For local state, use Zustand. However, most state is server state, so use React Query for that.
  Always use a selector with Zustand to subscribe only to the specific slice of state you need (e.g., useStore(s => s.foo)) rather than the whole store to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Make sure that the value returned by the selector is a primitive. Do not execute store methods in selectors; select data/functions, then compute outside the selector.
  For persistence: use AsyncStorage inside context hook providers. Only persist necessary data.
  Split ephemeral from persisted state to avoid hydration bugs.
</state>

<safearea>
  Import from react-native-safe-area-context, NOT from react-native.
  Skip SafeAreaView inside tab stacks with navigation headers.
  Skip when using native headers from Stack/Tab navigator.
  Add when using custom/hidden headers.
  For games: use useSafeAreaInsets hook instead.
</safearea>

<data>
  Create realistic mock data when you lack access to real data.
  For image analysis: actually send to LLM don't mock.
</data>

<design>
  Don't hold back. This is mobile — design for touch, thumb zones, glanceability.
  Inspiration: iOS, Instagram, Airbnb, Coinbase, polished habit trackers.

  <avoid>
    Purple gradients on white, generic centered layouts, predictable patterns.
    Web-like designs on mobile. Overused fonts (Space Grotesk, Inter).
  </avoid>

  <do>
    Cohesive themes with dominant colors and sharp accents.
    High-impact animations: progress bars, button feedback, haptics.
    Depth via gradients and patterns, not flat solids.
    Install `@expo-google-fonts/{font-name}` for fonts (eg: `@expo-google-fonts/inter`)
    Use zeego for context menus and dropdowns (native feel). Lookup the documentation on zeego.dev to see how to use it.
  </do>
</design>

<mistakes>
  <styling>
    Use Nativewind for styling. Use cn() helper from src/lib/cn.ts to merge classNames when conditionally applying classNames or passing classNames via props.
    CameraView, LinearGradient, and Animated components DO NOT support className. Use inline style prop.
    Horizontal ScrollViews will expand vertically to fill flex containers. Add `style={{ flexGrow: 0 }}` to constrain height to content.
  </styling>

  <camera>
    Use CameraView from expo-camera, NOT the deprecated Camera import.
    import { CameraView, CameraType, useCameraPermissions } from 'expo-camera';
    Use style={{ flex: 1 }}, not className.
    Overlay UI must be absolute positioned inside CameraView.
  </camera>

  <react_native>
    No Node.js buffer in React Native — don't import from 'buffer'.
  </react_native>

  <ux>
    Use Pressable over TouchableOpacity.
    Use custom modals, not Alert.alert().
    Ensure keyboard is dismissable and doesn't obscure inputs. This is much harder to implement than it seems. You can use the react-native-keyboard-controller package to help with this. But, make sure to look up the documentation before implementing.
  </ux>

  <outdated_knowledge>
    Your react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler training may be outdated. Look up current docs before implementing.
  </outdated_knowledge>

<skills>
You have access to a few skills in the `.claude/skills` folder. Use them to your advantage.
- ai-apis-like-chatgpt: Use this skill when the user asks you to make an app that requires an AI API.
- expo-docs: Use this skill when the user asks you to use an Expo SDK module or package that you might not know much about.
- frontend-app-design: Use this skill when the user asks you to design a frontend app component or screen.
