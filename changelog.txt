# Changelog

## January 19, 2026

### Security
- Moved OpenAI API key to server-side Edge Function (no longer exposed in client bundle)
- Added server-side rate limiting to prevent abuse (50 requests/user/hour, 100 requests/minute globally)

### Added
- **Monthly quota limits** for all users (including Pro) to prevent runaway API costs
  - Free: 5 scans/month, 15 wardrobe adds/month
  - Pro: 500 scans/month, 1000 wardrobe adds/month
- Server-side quota enforcement via Supabase Edge Function
- Idempotency keys to prevent double-charging on retries
- Auto-retry when app returns from background during analysis
- Credit consumption details added to Help Center (explains when credits are used)

### Fixed
- **Storage upload RLS errors**: Added session verification before background uploads to prevent "row-level security policy" errors when session expires or app restarts before auth is restored
- Wardrobe adds now consume from correct quota pool (was incorrectly using scan credits)
- Dark overlay on logout/transition screens now covers full screen edge-to-edge
- Analysis failures when app goes to background now auto-retry on return
- Paywall no longer interrupts users who used their last credit successfully (was showing paywall after analysis completed)
- **Scan flow now shows paywall BEFORE capture** when quota exceeded (previously let users scan then blocked them after)
- Scan paywall now shows correct title "You've used your 5 free scans" (was showing wrong paywall type)

### Improved
- **Add wardrobe item performance**: Removed redundant client-side quota check (~100-200ms faster)
- Skip cache lookup for wardrobe adds (user photos are unlikely to be cached, saves ~189ms on misses)
- Image picker no longer forces cropping (iOS limitation prevented free-form crop, now uses full image)
- AI now generates richer style notes (2 descriptive sentences instead of short phrases)

### Technical
- New Edge Function: `analyze-image` handles auth, quota, rate limits, and OpenAI calls
- Database migration: `006_monthly_quotas.sql` adds monthly tracking columns and functions
- `analyzeClothingImage` now accepts `operationType` ('scan' | 'wardrobe_add') and `skipCache` params
